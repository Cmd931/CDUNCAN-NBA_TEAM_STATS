# Cordero Duncan`s NBA STATS Capstone 
This is my Capstone for the Data Analytics Cohort 1. For my Capstone I analyzed NBA Data from the past five season to see if teams playing back to back games are at a disadvantage. 


#The DATA 
For my analyses I used NBA Team stats and schedule data from www.basketball-reference.com and NBA.com 
 I also used detail from  Wikipedia to get info about the arena capacity for each team. 
The tools I used for my analysis were postgres, excel, and tableau
 I created a relational database which contained the following three tables, arena, schedule, and stats.
